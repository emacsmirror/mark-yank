#+TITLE: Mark Yank for Emacs

* Overview

  This simple Emacs minor mode provides the command =mark-yank= that marks the last yank / paste
  in the current buffer.

  When the mode is enabled, it advises the =yank= command and records the location. When the
  =mark-yank= command is invoked, it sets the mark and point to the recorded location and
  activates the region.

* Installation

  The package will be available on MELPA.  In the meantime, checkout this repo or download the
  lisp file.  Ensure the location of the file is on your load path.

  Once the package is installed, you'll need to load and activate =mark-yank-mode= in your Emacs
  configuration:

  #+begin_src elisp
    (require 'mark-yank-mode)
    (mark-yank-mode)
  #+end_src

  If you use =use-package=, use something like this:

  #+begin_src elisp
    (use-package mark-yank
      :ensure t
      :demand t
      :bind ("C-M-y" . 'mark-yank)
      :config (mark-yank-mode 1))
  #+end_src
